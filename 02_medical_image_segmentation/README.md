# Medical Image Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based medical image segmentation system using U-Net with attention mechanisms. The system can segment various medical imaging modalities, with a focus on tumor detection and organ segmentation.

## Features
- Multi-modal medical image segmentation
- Tumor detection and segmentation
- Organ segmentation
- Attention mechanisms for improved accuracy
- 3D visualization of segmentation results

## Dataset
The project uses the following datasets:
- BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset
- ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset
- LiTS (Liver Tumor Segmentation) dataset

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI)
- SimpleITK
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset --model unet
python predict.py --model path/to/model --image path/to/image
```
